# TODO

Active sprint for the Market Analysis Agent.

> **Scope:** v2 per [ADR 0003](../docs/adr/0003-pivot-equity-research.md). The v2 product is the **AI Equity Research Assistant**: free data only, citation discipline non-negotiable. Phase 1 infrastructure complete.
>
> **Product shape:** [ADR 0004](../docs/adr/0004-visual-first-product-shape.md) — visual-first, delta-driven. Multi-year history rendered as charts; LLM commentary stays short. **Not** chasing Morningstar-depth analyst narrative.
>
> **Surface shape:** [ADR 0005](../docs/adr/0005-symbol-centric-dashboard.md) — pivot from "click Generate → static report" to **symbol-centric dashboard** (`/symbol/:ticker`) with adaptive layouts. Same backend; new frontend architecture.

## In progress

- **Phase 4 — Symbol-centric dashboard rebuild** (Strata design from user's prototyping session). **4.0 done (PR #46); 4.1 done (PR #47); 4.2 done (PR #48); 4.3.A done (PR #49); 4.3.A.1 done (PR #50); 4.3.X data correctness pass done (PR #51 — six bugs from [dogfood-2026-05-03.md](dogfood-2026-05-03.md)); 4.3.B Haiku risk categorizer done (PR #52); 4.3.B.1 layout polish + range pills + responsive SVGs done (PR #53); 4.3.B.2 price chart axes + hover tooltip done (PR #54); 4.4.A News + Business + ContextBand in flight (this PR); 4.4.B per-card section narratives follows.** See [ADR 0005](../docs/adr/0005-symbol-centric-dashboard.md).

## Phase 4 — Symbol-centric dashboard (active)

> **Why this is Phase 4:** dogfooding the Phase 3 visual depth (sparklines, section charts, peer scatter) against MSFT / NVDA / AMZN / AAPL / RIVN locally surfaced that the *data and visualization were right* but the *container was wrong*. "Click Generate → scroll a static report" feels like a generated artifact, not a tool. profitviz / stockanalysis / finchat all converge on a symbol-centric dashboard for a reason. See [ADR 0005](../docs/adr/0005-symbol-centric-dashboard.md) for the full reasoning.
>
> **What this is NOT:** a polish task. The Strata design pivot is structural — adaptive layouts (RIVN reframes to cash runway / burn / risk; healthy names show valuation + quality + growth), bookmarkable URLs, sidebar persistence, and Compare mode are all impossible in the report shape regardless of how much polish we apply.
>
> **Phase 3 status:** schema (3.1) ✅; data-tool history (3.2.A–F) ✅; frontend visualization (3.3.A–C) ✅; eval rubric history (3.4) ✅. All survives. The frontend visualizations get partially deprecated — `Sparkline` and the chart helpers live on; `SectionChart` / `PeerScatter` / `ReportRenderer` get replaced by Strata variants. The `/v1/research/{symbol}` endpoint and same-day cache layer stay; the renderer that consumes them is what changes.
>
> **Vercel deploy:** moved from Phase 3.5 to Phase 4.8. Holding the deploy until the new UI lands rather than shipping a public deploy that immediately needs a redesign.

### 4.0 Token system + sidebar shell + route refactor ✅ done *(this PR)*

- [x] **Tailwind extend with Strata tokens** — slate base (canvas / surface / raise / line / border / muted / dim / fg / hi), 9 semantic accents (valuation / quality / growth / cashflow / balance / earnings / peers / macro / risk), 4 state colors (pos / neg / neutral / highlight), Inter + JetBrains Mono font families, `letterSpacing.kicker` for category labels.
- [x] **`SidebarShell`** — 72 px fixed-width left rail with brand mark + 5 nav buttons. Search wired (opens stub modal); Compare / Watchlist / Recent / Export disabled in 4.0 (activate in 4.6/4.7).
- [x] **`RequireAuth`** — route guard; redirects to /login when no token; preserves original URL via location state.
- [x] **`AppShell`** — sidebar + main outlet; persistent across authenticated routes.
- [x] **`LandingPage`** — `/` route. Centered search bar + Recent reports list (`PastReportsList` integration). Submit navigates to `/symbol/:ticker` (uppercased).
- [x] **`SymbolDetailPage`** — `/symbol/:ticker` route. Reads URL param, fetches via existing TanStack Query path, renders hero placeholder + restyled `ReportRenderer`. Centralized 401 → clear token + bounce to /login.
- [x] **`react-router-dom@^6`** added (~7 KB gz net after the rest of the changes).
- [x] **Existing components restyled for dark theme** — `ReportRenderer`, `Sparkline`, `ConfidenceBadge`, `LoadingState`, `ErrorBanner`, `PastReportsList`, `LoginScreen` all switched to Strata tokens.
- [x] **Deleted** — `Dashboard.tsx`, `ReportForm.tsx` (replaced by AppShell + LandingPage + SymbolDetailPage split).
- [x] **111/111 frontend tests pass** (was 94; +17). Bundle 83.84 KB gz (was 76.92; +7 KB) — under 100 KB budget.
- [ ] **`SearchModal` (deferred to 4.7)** — Search button currently focuses the landing-page input; modal lands when watchlist + recent functionality also do.
- [ ] **Backend additions deferred to 4.1** — `/v1/market/:ticker/prices?range=60D` and logo URL resolution land alongside hero card implementation.

### 4.1 Hero card + Earnings card ✅ done *(this PR)*

- [x] **`HeroCard`** — three-column glow-shadowed card. Logo letter circle + ticker eyebrow + sector tag + name + big tabular price + colored delta + MCAP/VOL/52W meta (left); 60-day price chart with 6 range pills (center); 3 featured stats with peer/historical sub-context (right).
- [x] **`EarningsCard`** — replaces ReportRenderer's Earnings claims table. "X of N beat consensus" headline + Next print date + EpsBars chart + 3 stat tiles (Beat rate / Surprise μ / EPS TTM, the last computed client-side from history).
- [x] **`LineChart` primitive** — hand-rolled SVG, default 560×140, configurable stroke + optional area fill. Used by HeroCard's price chart.
- [x] **`EpsBars` primitive** — 20-bar SVG chart. Beat/miss coloring (strata-pos / strata-neg); estimate ticks render as horizontal lines for periods with matching estimates; negative actuals (RIVN-class) render with a zero baseline.
- [x] **`hero-extract.ts`** — pure helper pulls hero data via description matching; reads top-level `name`/`sector` from ResearchReport.
- [x] **Backend: `GET /v1/market/:ticker/prices?range={60D|1Y|5Y}`** — read-through `candles` cache; falls through to `ingest_market_data` (yfinance) on cache miss with 80% coverage threshold.
- [x] **Backend: 4 new fundamentals claims** — `name`, `sector_tag`, `fifty_two_week_high`, `fifty_two_week_low`. Plus orchestrator lifts `name`/`sector` to top-level `ResearchReport.name`/`.sector` (Pydantic + Zod schema mirrored).
- [x] **Visible after 4.1:** `/symbol/AAPL` renders a real hero region with price chart + 3 KPIs + 20-quarter earnings history. Backend 522/522, frontend 146/146 tests pass; main bundle 86.82 KB gz.

### 4.2 Quality scorecard + Valuation matrix + PeerScatter v2 ✅ done *(this PR)*

> **Scope:** all-frontend. No backend changes. Replaces ReportRenderer's
> Valuation / Quality / Peers cards with dedicated Strata variants;
> introduces two hand-rolled SVG primitives so the 4.2 work doesn't lean
> on Recharts. The Recharts shared chunk stays for now (SectionChart still
> uses it for Capital Allocation / Macro until 4.3); PeerScatter's recharts
> dep is gone — the file is deleted.

- [x] **`MetricRing` primitive** — circular SVG ring with center value, label below, optional sub-label. Configurable accent + ratio (0–1, clamped). Hand-rolled. `data-testid='metric-ring'`. 8 tests.
- [x] **`MultiLine` primitive** — 2-4 series on a shared axis with x-labels + 3 horizontal grid lines + per-series legend chip row. Hand-rolled SVG. Used by QualityCard's gross/operating/FCF margin chart. `data-testid='multi-line'`. 8 tests.
- [x] **`QualityCard`** — replaces ReportRenderer's Quality section card. Header (kicker + ticker eyebrow) → 3 MetricRings (ROE, ROIC TTM, FCF margin) → MultiLine (Gross / Operating / FCF margins) → hybrid claims table: default 6 (ROE / Gross margin / Operating margin / FCF margin / ROIC / Net profit margin) with "Show all 16" disclosure. Disclosure auto-hides when there are ≤6 claims to avoid the "show all 5" awkward case. 8 tests.
- [x] **`ValuationCard`** — replaces ReportRenderer's Valuation + Peers section cards. Header → 4-cell grid (P/E trailing, P/E forward, P/S, EV/EBITDA), each cell shows subject value + peer median + horizontal percentile bar (peer min → max with subject dot + median tick) → PeerScatterV2 below. 7 tests.
- [x] **`PeerScatterV2`** — hand-rolled SVG (replaces 3.3.C Recharts version). 3 axis presets via inline pill row: **P/E × Gross Margin** (default), **P/S × Gross Margin**, **EV/EBITDA × Gross Margin**. All three pairs drawn from the 4 existing `PEER_METRICS` so 4.2 needs no backend change. Subject as larger labeled colored dot; peers as smaller dots with inline ticker labels; median as a small cross. X + Y axis labels + min/max ticks visible. 9 tests.
- [x] **`quality-extract.ts`** — `extractQualityRings(section)` returns `{roe, roic, fcfMargin}`; `extractMarginSeries(section)` returns 3 history series for MultiLine; `extractPrimaryQualityClaims(section)` + `extractAllQualityClaims(section)` for the 6+expand split. 11 tests.
- [x] **`valuation-extract.ts`** — for each of the 4 metrics: `{subject, peerMedian, peerMin, peerMax, percentile}`. Reads Valuation section for subject and Peers section for peer/median values. Percentile = `count(peer ≤ subject) / peer_count`; null when subject missing or peer set < 2. 8 tests.
- [x] **`peer-grouping.ts` extension** — generic `groupPeersForAxes(claims, xMetric, yMetric)` and `extractMedianForAxes(claims, xMetric, yMetric)` so PeerScatterV2 can pivot axes; legacy `groupPeers` / `extractMedian` re-implement on top of the generic helpers. 9 new tests.
- [x] **SymbolDetailPage** — plucks Quality section; renders `<ValuationCard report={…}/>` and `<QualityCard section={…}/>` above ReportRenderer; ReportRenderer's `excludeSections` widens to `["Earnings","Valuation","Quality","Peers"]`.
- [x] **Deleted** `components/PeerScatter.tsx` + `.test.tsx` (3.3.C Recharts version replaced by v2). ReportRenderer's lazy `PeerScatter` import + isPeers handling removed; SectionChart still lazy-loaded for Capital Allocation / Macro.
- [x] **Net result:** 204/204 frontend tests pass (was 146 + 7 PeerScatter; +65 net new across 5 components + 2 extractors + 1 lib extension). Backend untouched at 522/522. Main bundle 90.20 KB gz (was 86.82; +3.4 KB; under 100 KB budget). SectionChart chunk now solo at 103 KB gz (used to share with PeerScatter; loads only on-demand for sections with featuredClaim). Typecheck + lint clean.

**Design decision: axis-preset list.** The original sketch was *P/E × Gross Margin / P/S × Operating Margin / EV/EBITDA × ROIC*. Backend `fetch_peers` only carries 4 metrics (`trailing_pe`, `p_s`, `ev_ebitda`, `gross_margin`); adding operating_margin + ROIC to peers requires per-peer TTM compute (the ROIC formula already exists for the subject in `fundamentals_history.py`). Deferring that backend extension keeps 4.2 frontend-only / one PR. The presets above are all peer-coverage-complete. Richer axis options come back in 4.5/4.8 if dogfooding asks for them.

### 4.3.A Per-share growth + Cash & capital + Risk diff + Macro ✅ done *(this PR)*

> **Scope:** all-frontend. No backend changes. Fills the row-3 (Per-share
> growth) and row-4 (Cash & capital + Risk diff + Macro) cards from the
> Strata design's `direction-strata.jsx`. Capital Allocation remains in
> ReportRenderer for now (its 6 non-history claims — dividend_yield,
> buyback_yield, sbc_pct_revenue, short_ratio, shares_short, market_cap
> — don't fit the 4 new cards cleanly; revisit in 4.4 if the context
> band absorbs them).

- [x] **`PerShareGrowthCard`** — 5 per-share history series (Revenue, Gross Profit, Op Income, FCF, OCF), each **rebased so the series' first point = 100**, plotted via existing `MultiLine` primitive. Below the chart: 5 multiplier pills ("Rev 6.2×", "GP 7.2×", etc.). Reads from Quality section. 7 tests.
- [x] **`CashAndCapitalCard`** — cross-section card. Top stack: `MultiLine` of CapEx + SBC per-share (from Capital Allocation). Bottom stack: `MultiLine` of Cash + Debt per-share (from Quality). Highlight box: Net cash / share = (cash − debt) at latest snapshot, colored pos/neg. 7 tests.
- [x] **`RiskDiffCard`** — inline horizontal bar chart of `{added, removed, kept, char_delta}` from the Risk Factors section's existing 4 claims. Prose summary below ("Disclosure expanded. Net +9 ¶ ..." / "Disclosure shrank ..." / "Disclosure stable ..."). When 4.3.B lands the Haiku categorizer, the bars become per-category — the card already gates on extractor returning null so pre-4.3.B reports keep rendering. 6 tests.
- [x] **`MacroPanel`** — vertical stack of mini area-chart panels (one per FRED series). Each panel: kicker label + current value badge + 36-month sparkline area chart via existing `LineChart` primitive (`areaFill={true}`). Reads from Macro section. 5 tests.
- [x] **`growth-extract.ts`** — `extractGrowthSeries(section)` returns 5 `MultiLineSeries` (rebased to first-point = 100); `extractGrowthMultipliers(section)` returns 5 `latest / first` ratios. Drops series whose history is empty or whose first value is zero. 8 tests.
- [x] **`cash-capital-extract.ts`** — `extractCapexSbcSeries(capAlloc)` + `extractCashDebtSeries(quality)` + `extractNetCashPerShare(quality)`. Net cash supports negative (debt-heavy) values. 10 tests.
- [x] **`risk-extract.ts`** — `extractRiskDiffBars(section)` returns `{added, removed, kept, charDelta} | null`; `extractRiskDiffSummary(section)` returns the prose framing (`"expanded"` / `"shrank"` / `"stable"`) + signed `netDelta`. 9 tests.
- [x] **`macro-extract.ts`** — `extractMacroPanels(section)` returns `{id, label, latest, history, observationDate}[]`. Reads `<label> (latest observation)` (value-bearing, history-bearing), `<label> observation date`, and the metadata claim `Human-readable label for FRED series <id>` for the optional id. Skips series with non-numeric latest or empty history. 6 tests.
- [x] **SymbolDetailPage** — plucks Quality, Capital Allocation, Risk Factors, Macro sections; renders `<PerShareGrowthCard>` after QualityCard, then a 3-column grid `<CashAndCapitalCard> | <RiskDiffCard> | <MacroPanel>` matching the design's row-4 layout. Widens `excludeSections` to `["Earnings","Valuation","Quality","Peers","Risk Factors","Macro"]` — Capital Allocation stays through ReportRenderer.
- [x] **Net result:** 262/262 frontend tests pass (was 204; +58 net new across 4 cards + 4 extractors). Backend untouched at 522/522. Main bundle 92.93 KB gz (was 90.20; +2.7 KB; under 100 KB budget). SectionChart chunk unchanged at 103 KB gz (still loads on-demand for Capital Allocation's featured-claim chart). Typecheck + lint clean.

### 4.3.X Data correctness + format-helper unit hint *(this PR)*

> **Why this PR exists:** dogfooding the post-PR-#50 dashboard surfaced
> six substantive bugs in five minutes — see [tasks/dogfood-2026-05-03.md](dogfood-2026-05-03.md).
> The cards look great but the *numbers are wrong* in places that matter
> (ROE displayed as `1.41` instead of `141%`, dividend yield as `39.09%`
> instead of `0.39%`, per-share dollars as `16.02%` instead of `$0.16`).
> Plus a critical FK violation in the prices route that breaks the
> HeroCard chart for every ticker that isn't NVDA or SPY.
>
> **Why before 4.4 / 4.5:** both downstream phases compound on the data
> + format layer. 4.5's adaptive-layout signals derive from the same
> `Claim.value`s being misformatted today. 4.4's per-card narratives
> need a clean per-card narrative-strip surface (item 3 below blocks).
> Cheaper to fix the foundation now than to layer features on a moving
> foundation.

- [x] **Schema unit hint** — `Claim.unit: ClaimUnit | None = None` shipped (Pydantic + Zod). 33 keys in `app/services/fundamentals.py` annotated via parallel `_UNITS` dict + import-time `assert _UNITS == CLAIM_KEYS` so a forgotten annotation fails loudly. Frontend `formatClaimValue(value, unit?)` dispatches deterministically; falls through to legacy heuristic when unit is undefined/null. Wired into QualityCard rings + claim table, ReportRenderer claim table, HeroCard ROIC/FCF, CashAndCapitalCard net cash. Fixes Bugs 2/3/4. *(Other tools — `peers`, `earnings`, `macro`, `research_tool_registry`, `form_4`, `holdings_13f` — keep their unit field default to `None` for now; the legacy heuristic handles their values correctly because the bugs were concentrated in `fetch_fundamentals`. Cleanup follow-up if/when those tools start rendering values that hit the same edge cases.)*

- [x] **Symbols upsert in price ingest path** — `data_ingestion.py::ingest_market_data` does `pg_insert(Symbol).on_conflict_do_nothing` before the candle insert. Test in `tests/test_market_prices.py::test_prices_succeeds_for_symbol_not_pre_seeded` asserts 200 + `Symbol` row created. Fixes Bug 1.

- [x] **Drop section narrative from `PerShareGrowthCard`** — `section.summary` block removed; comment notes per-card narratives return in 4.4. Test flipped to assert the prose is NOT in the card. Fixes Bug 5.

- [x] **HeroCard top-level metadata backfill** — `backfill_top_level_metadata(report)` helper added to `research_orchestrator.py`; called from `research.py` router after `lookup_recent` returns a hit. Lifts `Company name` / `Resolved sector tag` claim values to top-level when `report.name`/`.sector` are None. 3 unit tests pin happy path + preserve-existing-values + missing-claims-no-error. Fixes Bug 6 (a). VOL + 52W (b) come back automatically once fresh reports regenerate.

- [x] **Loading-state copy + ghost skeleton** — copy widened to "30–90 seconds"; ghost skeleton renders the dashboard's 4 row layout (Hero + 2-col 40/60 + 3-col grid) under `animate-pulse`. Fixes Bug 7.

- [x] **Cosmetic backlog from PR #50 audit** — all four shipped:
  - HeroCard exchange chip combining ticker + sector token (`data-testid='hero-exchange-chip'`).
  - ValuationCard "n = X peers · sector medians" annotation (`data-testid='valuation-peer-count'`); `countPeers` helper extracts distinct tickers from `<TICKER>: <metric>` claim descriptions.
  - QualityCard "MARGINS · 5Y" sub-kicker with inline GM/OM/FCF values via the same `formatClaimValue` (`data-testid='quality-margins-subkicker'`).
  - `MultiLine` paths switch to Catmull-Rom-to-Bezier monotone cubic curves (tension 1/6); endpoints mirror the nearest neighbor so curves start/end tangent without overshoot.

- [ ] **Defer:** Bug 8 (mid-flight nav silently cancels POST) — small standalone ticket; fix is risky enough to keep out of a polish PR.

- [x] **Capture lessons** — entry added to `tasks/lessons.md` covering (a) the heuristic-formatter trap, (b) the test-fixture dogfood gap, and (c) the symbols-FK seeding gotcha for /v1/market/:ticker/prices.

- [x] **Update test counts** — backend 522 → **531** (+9), frontend 262 → **277** (+15). Updated in `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, this file. Main bundle 92.98 → **93.95 KB gz** (+0.97; under 100 KB budget, ~6 KB headroom retained).

### 4.3.X review *(filled in after the GREEN + docs commits land)*

- **What changed in shape:** `Claim.unit` is the only new schema field; everything else lives behind it (frontend dispatch + tool annotations) or is pure presentation (cosmetic backlog) / single-line correctness (symbols upsert) / single helper (backfill_top_level_metadata).
- **What didn't change:** the surface of `POST /v1/research/{symbol}` is unchanged for callers that don't read `unit` — backwards-compat default `None` keeps pre-4.3.X cached JSONB rows round-tripping.
- **Net deltas:** backend +9 tests, frontend +15 tests, main bundle +0.97 KB gz. No new dependencies, no new chunks.
- **Followups noted but deferred:** unit annotations for the other 5 tools (peers / earnings / macro / research_tool_registry / form_4 / holdings_13f) — wait until a specific bug surfaces; cancel-on-nav (Bug 8) — small standalone ticket; per-card narratives — return in 4.4.

### 4.3.B Risk Haiku categorizer *(this PR)*

> **Why:** RiskDiffCard currently shows 4 aggregate bars (added /
> removed / kept / char-delta) — useful but missing the "what kind of
> risk grew?" signal. The Strata design's screenshot 1 shows 8
> per-category bars (AI / supply / cyber / competition / IP / macro /
> regulatory / other). The aggregates miss the texture: NVDA might
> add 5 paragraphs about export controls and remove 2 about FX while
> a competitor adds 4 about competition and 3 about cybersecurity —
> both look like "+3 ¶" in the aggregate.
>
> Cost discipline: Haiku-only (~$0.001-0.005/report on typical 10–15
> paragraph diffs). Skipped entirely when added+removed = 0 so a
> stable disclosure costs nothing. Backwards-compat: pre-4.3.B
> cached rows lack the per-category fields, the card falls back to
> the aggregate bars.

#### Backend

- [x] **`RiskCategory` enum** in `app/schemas/ten_k.py` — 9 categories shipped: `AI_REGULATORY`, `EXPORT_CONTROLS`, `SUPPLY_CONCENTRATION`, `CUSTOMER_CONCENTRATION`, `COMPETITION`, `CYBERSECURITY`, `IP`, `MACRO`, `OTHER`. String-valued so JSONB serializes as plain strings.

- [x] **Extend `Risk10KDiff`** with `category_deltas: dict[RiskCategory, int] = Field(default_factory=dict)` — net delta per category. Default empty so pre-4.3.B JSONB rows round-trip unchanged.

- [x] **`app/services/risk_categorizer.py`** — `categorize_risk_paragraphs(added, removed)` short-circuits on empty inputs, otherwise issues one `triage_call` (Haiku 4.5) with the forced `RiskCategorization` tool schema. Drops zero-net buckets and defends against out-of-range indices in the model's response.

- [x] **Wire categorizer into `extract_10k_risks_diff`** — `try/except` around the call so categorizer failures (rate limit / network) degrade to `category_deltas={}` rather than failing the whole diff. Adds `category_buckets` count to the existing `log_external_call` output summary.

- [x] **`_build_risk_factors` in `research_tool_registry.py`** — emits one extra `Claim` per non-zero category with description `"<Label> risk paragraph delta vs prior 10-K"`. `_RISK_CATEGORY_LABELS` map centralizes the labels — frontend's `risk-extract.ts` mirrors them verbatim, kept in sync via `risk-extract.test.ts` description-match assertions.

- [x] **Frontend `risk-extract.ts`** — `extractRiskCategoryDeltas(section)` returns null when no per-category claims are present, otherwise a sorted `RiskCategoryDelta[]` (largest |delta| first). New `RiskCategory` type union + `RISK_CATEGORY_LABELS` map mirroring backend.

- [x] **`RiskDiffCard.tsx`** — when `extractRiskCategoryDeltas` returns non-null, renders the new `CategoryBars` SVG (positive deltas in risk accent, negative in quality accent, scaled to absolute max). Otherwise falls back to the existing 4-bar aggregate.

- [x] **Tests** — backend 531 → 544 (+13: 4 schema + 5 categorizer + 2 ten_k integration + 2 registry); frontend 277 → 285 (+8: 5 extractor + 3 card).

- [x] **Cost / observability** — categorizer skips Haiku entirely on `len(added)+len(removed)==0`. `log_external_call` records `category_buckets` count so cost-per-report is chartable from the A09 stream. Real-LLM cost validation deferred to dogfooding (target: ≤$0.005/report, $0 stable).

- [x] **Bundle** — main 93.95 → 94.40 KB gz (+0.45). Under 100 KB budget; ~5.6 KB headroom retained for 4.4. SectionChart on-demand chunk unchanged at 103.01 KB gz.

- [x] **Update test counts** — backend 531 → **544**, frontend 277 → **285**. Updated in `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, this file.

### 4.3.B review *(filled in after the GREEN + docs commits land)*

- **What changed in shape:** one new enum (`RiskCategory`) and one new dict field on `Risk10KDiff`; one new service module; one new wire-through; one new frontend extractor + bar chart. No new top-level routes, no schema breaks, no new dependencies.
- **What didn't change:** the 4 aggregate `Claim`s still ship for every diff so the existing card render path + extractor work on pre-4.3.B JSONB rows + on stable disclosures (the categorizer skips the Haiku call and `category_deltas` lands as `{}`).
- **Net deltas:** backend +13 tests / +1 service module; frontend +8 tests / +1 helper / 1 component upgrade; main bundle +0.45 KB gz. No ADR needed.
- **Followups noted:**
  - Real-LLM cost telemetry from a few dogfooded reports → confirm/refute the $0.005-target estimate.
  - The 9-bucket catalog will need to grow if `OTHER` dominates real diffs. Add a guardrail in 4.4 dogfooding to flag issuers where `OTHER >= 50%` of their bucketed paragraphs.

### 4.3.B.1 Layout polish + range pills + responsive SVGs *(this PR)*

> **Why:** dogfooding PR #51 surfaced four UX rough edges that don't
> warrant a phase rename but visibly hurt the dashboard's trust:
> price-chart pills 1D / 5D / 1M all rendered the same 60-bar chart
> (no client-side slicing); EarningsCard + PerShareGrowthCard had
> hundreds of pixels of empty canvas below their content (no row
> partner of similar height); chart elements escaped card borders on
> narrow viewports because every primitive hardcoded its width.

- [x] **Price chart pills** — `frontend/src/lib/price-range.ts::sliceForRange` slices the 60D feed to last 2 / 5 / 22 points for 1D / 5D / 1M; passes through unchanged for 3M / 1Y / 5Y. HeroCard wires it in front of LineChart's data prop and the subtitle reflects the actual span shown ("22 trading days" not "60 trading days").

- [x] **EarningsCard `RecentPrints`** — last-4-quarters mini-table below the 3 stat tiles. Period · actual · estimate · surprise %, surprise color-coded pos/neg. Hidden when section has no EPS history. Adds substantive content (not just height-padding) — recent prints is canonical for an earnings card.

- [x] **PerShareGrowthCard CAGR annotations** — each multiplier pill grows a sub-line "+58.3% / Q" computed via `extractGrowthCagr` (multiplier^(1/n_periods) − 1, defends against sign-change endpoints + zero/negative ratios). Em-dash on null. ~30px per pill row, closes most of the blank-canvas gap to ValuationCard.

- [x] **Responsive SVG widths** — LineChart, EpsBars, MultiLine, RiskDiffCard's aggregate bars switched from hardcoded `width` props to `width="100%"` with viewBox preserving internal coords. Chart elements stay inside the card border at any viewport. Height stays numeric so visual height is stable. Same pattern Sparkline already used.

- [x] **LineChart path discriminators** — `data-line-stroke` / `data-line-area` on the two paths so tests can count segments on the line specifically (the area path adds 3 extra commands when `areaFill={true}`).

- [x] **Tests** — frontend 277 → **295** (+18: 7 price-range/Hero, 3 RecentPrints, 3 CAGR, 4 SVG-width updates, 1 EarningsCard label-collision fix). Backend untouched at 531/531.

- [x] **Bundle** — main 93.95 → **94.46 KB gz** (+0.51). Under 100 KB budget; ~5.5 KB headroom retained for 4.4. SectionChart on-demand chunk unchanged at 103.01 KB.

### 4.3.B.2 Price chart axes + hover tooltip *(this PR)*

> **Why:** dogfooding PR #51 + #53 surfaced that the hero price chart
> read as decorative — the line shape was visible but you couldn't
> read prices, dates, or hover over it for exact values. The 4.1
> docstring (``no axes, no tooltip, no grid — the hero card composes
> those separately around the chart``) was a deferral that the hero
> never came back to.

- [x] **`LineChart` axis labels** — new opt-in `showAxes` prop renders y-axis min/max price labels formatted as `$X.XX` on the left edge and x-axis first/last date labels (UTC-formatted to avoid TZ drift, since yfinance timestamps bars at UTC midnight). Off by default so any non-Hero caller stays lean. New testids `line-chart-y-axis-{min,max}` + `line-chart-x-axis-{start,end}` for regression assertions.

- [x] **`LineChart` hover tooltip** — new opt-in `showTooltip` prop wires `onMouseMove` and `onMouseLeave` on the SVG. Cursor x maps to viewBox space via the SVG's bounding rect (with a happy-dom fallback for tests); nearest data point selected by linear scan. Three new SVG artifacts under stable testids: `line-chart-hover-{guide,dot,tooltip}` — guide is a vertical dashed line; dot is a filled circle on the line at the nearest point; tooltip is a small floating panel with date + price. Tooltip flips left when too close to the right edge so it stays in-frame.

- [x] **HeroCard wiring** — sets `showAxes={true} showTooltip={true}` on its LineChart. Other consumers (none today) keep the lean default.

- [x] **Bonus: rescue per-category bars regression** — the PR #52 ↔ PR #53 merge silently dropped the conditional render of `CategoryBars` in `RiskDiffCard.tsx`; the `CategoryBars` function survived in the file but was never called from JSX. Two of PR #52's tests were failing on main because of it. Restored the `{categoryDeltas ? <CategoryBars/> : <svg .../>}` ternary. Also made `CategoryBars`' SVG responsive width (matching what PR #53 did for the aggregate bars).

- [x] **Tests** — frontend 295 → **314** (+19: 13 LineChart axes/hover, 3 HeroCard wire-through, 2 rescued RiskDiffCard tests, 1 prior-test fix). Backend untouched at 544/544.

- [x] **Bundle** — main 94.46 → **95.71 KB gz** (+1.25). ~4.3 KB headroom retained under the 100 KB budget. SectionChart on-demand chunk unchanged at 103.01 KB.

### 4.4 News + Business + section narratives

> **Split:** ship as two PRs to keep each reviewable.
> - **4.4.A — ContextBand (Business + News)** *(this PR)*. The "above the grid" content the user expects from a research dashboard.
> - **4.4.B — Per-card section narratives** *(follow-up)*. Cross-cutting concern (touches every card + the synth call schema).

#### 4.4.A ContextBand: Business + News *(this PR)*

> **Why:** the dashboard at `/symbol/:ticker` opens straight into Hero → numeric grid. There's no "what does this company *do*" card and no "what's the latest news" feed. Both are canonical for a research dashboard and Strata's screenshot 5 calls them out as the ContextBand layer between Hero and the row-2 grid.

**Backend:**

- [ ] **`app/services/business_info.py`** — new tool `async def fetch_business_info(symbol)` returning `dict[str, Claim]`. Pulls from yfinance `Ticker.info`: `longBusinessSummary` (~3-5 sentences), city/state/country (joined as HQ string), `fullTimeEmployees`. Founded year skipped — yfinance doesn't carry it cleanly. One `log_external_call` record under service id `yfinance.business_info`.
- [ ] **`app/services/news.py`** — new `async def fetch_news(symbol) -> dict[str, Claim]`. Opens its own AsyncSession, calls `news_repository.list_news(symbol, hours=168, limit=30)`, calls `news_categorizer.categorize_news_headlines` to classify each headline, returns one Claim per article with description=title, value=sentiment, source.url=article_url, source.detail=`"category=<bucket>"`. Returns `{}` cleanly when no articles exist (no upstream-provider call yet — ingestion stays driven by `POST /v1/news/ingest`; revisit if dogfooding shows stale data).
- [ ] **`app/services/news_categorizer.py`** — mirrors `risk_categorizer.py`. Single Haiku call with a forced-tool `NewsCategorization` schema (`list[HeadlineClassification(index, category, sentiment)]`). Two enums: `NewsCategory` (EARNINGS / PRODUCT / REGULATORY / M_AND_A / SUPPLY / STRATEGY / OTHER, 7 buckets) + `NewsSentiment` (POSITIVE / NEUTRAL / NEGATIVE). Short-circuits on empty input. Defensive on out-of-range indices. Cost target ≤$0.005/report on a typical 20-30 headline batch.
- [ ] **`research_tool_registry.py`** — add `Business` and `News` sections to `SECTIONS_BY_FOCUS[Focus.FULL]` (placed first so the orchestrator processes them before the numeric sections). New `_build_business` + `_build_news` builders that pass through the tool's `dict[str, Claim]` directly. EARNINGS focus: News only (Business is full-research-only).
- [ ] **`research_orchestrator.py`** — wire `fetch_business_info` + `fetch_news` into `TOOL_DISPATCH`. Cache miss → fan-out runs them alongside fundamentals/peers/etc. via `asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True)`.

**Frontend:**

- [ ] **`lib/business-extract.ts`** — `extractBusinessInfo(section)` returns `{summary: string|null, hq: string|null, employeeCount: number|null}` from a Business section's claims.
- [ ] **`lib/news-extract.ts`** — `extractNewsItems(section)` returns `NewsItem[]` parsed from each Claim (description = title; value = sentiment; source.url = article url; source.detail's `category=<bucket>` substring → category enum). Drops malformed items.
- [ ] **`components/BusinessCard.tsx`** — single card. Header eyebrow "BUSINESS · {ticker}" + 1-paragraph summary (truncate to ~3 lines with overflow `...`) + small metadata row (HQ · {N} employees). Renders nothing when summary is empty.
- [ ] **`components/NewsList.tsx`** — header eyebrow "NEWS · LAST 7 DAYS · {N} items" + filter pill row (ALL / EARNINGS / PRODUCT / REGULATORY / M&A / SUPPLY / STRATEGY / OTHER) + 5 latest items by default with title/source/date + category chip + sentiment dot. "View {N} more" disclosure expands. State: filter selection + expand toggle.
- [ ] **`components/ContextBand.tsx`** — thin 2-col grid wrapper (40/60 same rhythm as rows 2 + 3) holding `<BusinessCard>` (left) + `<NewsList>` (right). Stacks 1-col below `lg:`. Returns null when both children empty.
- [ ] **`components/SymbolDetailPage.tsx`** — pluck `Business` + `News` sections, render `<ContextBand>` between `<HeroCard>` and the row-2 grid.

**Tests:**

- [ ] Backend ~14 new: 5 categorizer (mirrors risk_categorizer's pattern), 3 business_info, 3 news fetch, 2 registry section-builders, 1 orchestrator wire-through.
- [ ] Frontend ~10 new: 2 business-extract, 3 news-extract, 2 BusinessCard, 2 NewsList, 1 ContextBand.

**Bundle math:** main currently 95.71 KB / 100 KB gz → 4.3 KB headroom. NewsList (~3 KB) + BusinessCard (~1 KB) + ContextBand (~0.5 KB) ≈ 4.5 KB total. **Tight — may need to lazy-load NewsList** if final size pushes over budget. Decide after the implementation lands.

#### 4.4.B Per-card section narratives *(follow-up PR)*

- [ ] **Backend** — orchestrator's synth call returns one card-level narrative per section title (e.g. `card_narratives: dict[str, str]`). Each card receives a 1-2 sentence inline interp ("Loss is narrowing. EPS −3.82 → −0.78 over 20Q — no positive print"). Schema gets a new `Section.card_narrative: str | None` field; sonnet's tool schema extends to populate it.
- [ ] **Frontend** — each card grows a narrative strip below its data. PerShareGrowthCard's narrative comes back here (4.3.X removed it because it duplicated Quality's `section.summary`; the per-card field replaces it cleanly).
- [ ] **Eval rubric** — card narratives covered by the existing factuality rubric (history-aware after 3.4).

### 4.5 Adaptive layout for distressed names *(the differentiator)*

- [ ] **Backend signals** — extend `compose_research_report` to compute layout flags from claim values: `is_unprofitable_ttm`, `beat_rate_below_30pct`, `cash_runway_quarters` (derived from net cash / FCF burn TTM), `gross_margin_negative`, `debt_rising_cash_falling`. Payload field `layout_signals: dict[str, bool | float]`.
- [ ] **Layout substitution rules** — when `is_unprofitable_ttm`: hero swaps Forward P/E → P/Sales, ROIC → Cash Runway, FCF Margin stays but with red coloring. When `beat_rate_below_30pct`: Earnings card adds "bottom decile" annotation. When `cash_runway_quarters < 6`: Cash & Capital card adds "raise likely needed" annotation + runway highlight.
- [ ] **Header pills** — "● UNPROFITABLE · TTM" and "⚠ LIQUIDITY WATCH" pills in the page header for distressed names; nothing for healthy names.
- [ ] **Section ordering changes** — for distressed names, Cash & Capital moves up (above Per-share growth); Risk diff moves up (above Macro). Layout flags drive the section order.
- [ ] **Narratives adapt** — section narratives reference the distressed framing ("Trajectory positive, level negative. Gross margin up 226 pts in 5Y but still below break-even"). Sonnet prompts include the layout signals as context.
- [ ] **Test fixtures** — at least 4 fixture symbols covering the matrix: healthy mature (NVDA, AAPL), slowing growth (F, GM), unprofitable growth (RIVN, LCID), distressed (any name with runway < 4Q at the time of writing).

### 4.6 Compare page

- [ ] **`/compare?a=NVDA&b=AVGO`** route — two-ticker side-by-side dashboard.
- [ ] **`CompareHero`** — two ticker cards side-by-side with mini price charts in the subject's accent color (NVDA cyan, AVGO violet say). "VS" indicator between them.
- [ ] **Valuation comparison** — 4 metrics (P/E forward, P/S, EV/EBITDA, PEG) shown as horizontal bars between the two values with "lower = cheaper" hint.
- [ ] **Quality comparison** — 4 metrics (Gross margin, Operating margin, FCF margin, ROIC) with horizontal bars.
- [ ] **Overlay charts** — 20Q operating margin, 5Y per-share growth (both rebased) with both tickers on shared axes. Narrative call-out below each chart ("NVDA's operating margin overtook AVGO's in Q2-23. AVGO is the steadier business; NVDA captured the cycle").
- [ ] **Risk diff side-by-side** — both tickers' 10-K risk paragraph deltas as parallel bar charts.
- [ ] **"What's cut" footer** — explicitly lists what doesn't appear in compare mode (Macro, full Business descriptions, News). Honest about scope.
- [ ] **Add ticker / Swap controls** — top-right.

### 4.7 Search + Watchlist + Recent

- [ ] **Search modal** (`⌘K`) — full ticker search; landed in skeleton form in 4.0, fully functional here. Recent + watchlist surfaced inline.
- [ ] **Watchlist** — localStorage-backed list of tickers; sidebar Watch icon shows live count badge. Clicking a watchlist entry navigates to `/symbol/:ticker`.
- [ ] **Recent ticker tracking** — last ~10 visited tickers stored in localStorage. Surfaced in sidebar Recent panel + landing page.
- [ ] **Landing page (`/`)** — search bar, recent tickers as cards (with mini price sparklines), watchlist as a second section, "What's new" feed pulling from `fetch_news` (sector-level instead of per-ticker).

### 4.8 Vercel deploy + dogfood gate

- [ ] **Vercel push-to-deploy** from `frontend/`. Set `VITE_BACKEND_URL`, set backend `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`, set `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET` on both sides.
- [ ] **Backend env-var hardening** — confirm Fly secrets match the new dashboard's needs (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `NEWSAPI_KEY`, `FRED_API_KEY`, `BACKEND_SHARED_SECRET`).
- [ ] **Dogfood** the deployed stack against 8–10 real symbols spanning the layout matrix (healthy mega-cap, growth, distressed, dividend payer, cyclical). Note rough edges.
- [ ] **Decision gate for Phase 5 vs Phase 6:** if dogfooding surfaces "I want a real bull/bear case" repeatedly, escalate to Phase 5 (narrative layer). If it surfaces "I need segment / geography breakdowns", escalate to Phase 6 (XBRL Tier 2). If neither dominates, the dashboard is the product and remaining work is polish.
- [ ] **README + design_doc + CLAUDE.md** sweep — current state reflects Phase 4, screenshots, deploy URL. Update portfolio framing too.

## Phase 5 — Narrative layer (deferred; after Phase 4 dogfooding)

> **Deferred** until Phase 4 ships and is dogfooded. The dashboard's adaptive layout for distressed names (Phase 4.5) plus inline section narratives (Phase 4.4) already deliver a meaningful slice of "what would Bulls Say / Bears Say articulate?" — the killer questions ("EPS narrowing toward break-even but cash runway tightening" or "Operating margin expansion outpacing peers") get answered by the dashboard's data presentation. Phase 5 lands only if dogfooding surfaces a recurring "I want a real bull/bear case" signal that the inline narratives don't satisfy.

- [ ] **Bulls Say / Bears Say** sections — explicit bullet lists with `claim_refs: list[str]` per argument so the rubric can enforce "every bullet cites at least one Claim." Schema work + LLM prompt work + rubric extension all required.
- [ ] **What Changed** section — surfaces quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year deltas mechanically (from Phase 3 history). LLM writes 1–2 sentence framing per delta. Some of this already exists implicitly in Phase 4.5 adaptive narratives.
- [ ] **Catalyst awareness** — already partially in Phase 4.4 (next-print date + recent news with sentiment). Phase 5 expansion would tie news directly to the bull/bear thesis ("Q3 print added +7 ¶ to risk factors — feeds the bear case below").
- [ ] **`?focus=thesis`** — new focus mode oriented around the bull/bear case for active investing decisions, complementing existing `full` (broad diligence) and `earnings` (event-driven).

## Phase 6 — XBRL Tier 2 (deferred; conditional on Phase 4.8 dogfood signal)

> **Deferred** until Phase 4.8 dogfooding shows the segment / geography / RPO breakdowns are repeatedly missed. The Phase 4 dashboard has placeholder cards in the context band for "Revenue mix by segment" and "Revenue mix by geography" that render "data not available" until this lands. If users repeatedly note the gap (especially for names where segment mix is the story — NVDA Data Center vs Gaming, AMZN AWS vs Retail), escalate.

- [ ] **XBRL parser** — pick `python-xbrl` or `arelle`; reuse `fetch_edgar`'s polite-crawl + disk-cache infrastructure. One-time effort; pays for itself across all SEC filers.
- [ ] **`fetch_segments` (new tool)** — parses `us-gaap:SegmentReportingDisclosure` from the latest 10-K + every 10-Q since. Returns revenue + operating income time series per reportable segment.
- [ ] **`fetch_geographic_revenue` (new tool)** — parses geographic-disaggregation tags. Returns revenue time series by region (US / Taiwan / China / etc., per the company's reporting structure — no normalization).
- [ ] **`fetch_rpo_history` (new tool, conditional)** — `us-gaap:RevenueRemainingPerformanceObligation` + `RemainingPerformanceObligationExpectedTimingOfSatisfactionPercentage` for the NTM%. Renders only when the company reports it (mostly SaaS / subscription / defense).
- [ ] **Frontend additions** — `SegmentDonut` (TTM share) + `SegmentTimeSeries` + `GeographyDonut` + `GeographyTimeSeries` + `RPOCard` rendered into the Phase 4.4 ContextBand placeholders.

## Other deferred Phase 3 work (rolled forward; revisit case-by-case)

These were sketched during Phase 3 but never landed; either Phase 4 absorbs them (news, price history) or they stay deferred:

- [x] **News in report** — absorbed into Phase 4.4 (NewsList component + Haiku categorization).
- [ ] **`fetch_valuation_history` (new derived tool)** — rolling P/E / EV/EBIT / EV/EBITDA over time with median bands. Would unlock a SectionChart for Valuation. *(Still deferred — Phase 4.2's Valuation matrix uses point-in-time + peer percentile bars instead. Revisit if Phase 4.8 dogfooding shows users want "trades at 28× vs 5Y median 26×" framing.)*
- [ ] **`fetch_dividends_history` (new tool, conditional)** — yfinance `Ticker.dividends` for quarterly history; would unlock a `DividendsCard`. *(Still deferred — niche to dividend payers. Revisit if a recurring use case surfaces.)*
- [ ] **Price-and-technicals history** — partially absorbed into Phase 4.0/4.1 (60-day price chart in hero). Full SMA / RSI overlay and 5Y price view still TBD; revisit if Phase 4.8 dogfooding shows demand.

## Cross-cutting (do alongside, not blocked on Phase 4)

- [ ] Turn on branch protection for `main` and add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a repo secret for the AI PR review job
- [ ] `.python-version` already pinned; verify it's respected by CI's uv setup
- [ ] **Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a Fly secret** — needed before `/v1/research/*` works in prod: `fly secrets set 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...'`
- [ ] **Local-dev defaults sweep** — write a `LOCAL_DEV.md` in the repo root capturing the Phase 3 dogfood lessons: (1) `.env` `DATABASE_URL` should default to local Docker (`postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/marketdb`) not Neon; (2) Windows users with native Postgres on :5432 need to either stop the service or remap docker to :5433; (3) `RESEARCH_CACHE_MAX_AGE_HOURS=0` disables cache for debug; (4) browser extensions can rewrite responses — test in incognito to isolate.
- [ ] **`.env.example`** — recommend `FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173` as the obvious local-dev value (currently empty trips up fresh-clone sessions).

## Future scope (deliberately deferred — revisit when there's a concrete trigger)

- [ ] **`search_history`** — pgvector RAG over stored news + filings. Was the original "Phase 3" sketch in ADR 0003. Demoted by ADR 0004 because it doesn't address the perceived-shallowness gap. Revisit if a recurring eval query genuinely benefits from semantic search across our corpus.
- [ ] **`compute_options`** — yfinance options chain → IV percentile, implied move. Was the other half of the original "Phase 3" sketch. Demoted similarly. Revisit if Phase 4's Catalyst section needs implied-move framing.
- [ ] **LLM-driven section composition** (was 2.2d) — replace the static `SECTION_TO_CLAIM_KEYS` map with LLM triage. No signal yet that the deterministic catalog is too rigid.
- [ ] **Supervisor mode** (was 2.3) — multi-symbol comparative queries via specialist sub-agents. No signal that it adds factuality / structure benefit over the single-agent default.
- [ ] **Reddit / r/wallstreetbets sentiment** — narrow signal, high noise. Per ADR 0003 cut from must-have.
- [ ] **Discord bot client** — was original v1 vision; deferred indefinitely.
- [ ] **Real-time / 15-min scheduled ingest, Celery, Redis** — cut by ADR 0003.
- [ ] **Real auth + per-user cost caps + abuse logging** — only when there are real users. Phase 3.0's shared-secret gate is enough until then.
